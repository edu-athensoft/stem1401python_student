[Homework, Demo]
1. Write a Python script to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by value.

2. Write a Python script to add a key to a dictionary.
Sample Dictionary : {0: 10, 1: 20}
Expected Result : {0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}

3. Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one.
Sample Dictionary :
dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}
dic3={5:50,6:60}
Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

4. Write a Python script to check whether a given key already exists in a dictionary.

5. Write a Python program to iterate over dictionaries using for loops.

6. Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x).
Sample Dictionary ( n = 5) :
Expected Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

7. Write a Python script to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 (both included) and the values are square of keys.
Sample Dictionary
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196, 15: 225}

8. Write a Python script to merge two Python dictionaries.

9. Write a Python program to iterate over dictionaries using for loops.

10. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a dictionary.

11. Write a Python program to multiply all the items in a dictionary.

12. Write a Python program to remove a key from a dictionary.

13. Write a Python program to map two lists into a dictionary.

14. Write a Python program to sort a dictionary by key.

15. Write a Python program to get the maximum and minimum value in a dictionary.

16. Write a Python program to get a dictionary from an object's fields.

17. Write a Python program to remove duplicates from Dictionary.

18. Write a Python program to check a dictionary is empty or not.

19. Write a Python program to combine two dictionary adding values for common keys.
d1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c':300}
d2 = {'a': 300, 'b': 200, 'd':400}
Sample output: Counter({'a': 400, 'b': 400, 'd': 400, 'c': 300})

20. Write a Python program to print all unique values in a dictionary.
Sample Data : [{"V":"S001"}, {"V": "S002"}, {"VI": "S001"}, {"VI": "S005"}, {"VII":"S005"}, {"V":"S009"},{"VIII":"S007"}]
Expected Output : Unique Values: {'S005', 'S002', 'S007', 'S001', 'S009'}
