"""
1. You use lists and tuples when you need an ordered collection where you can easily index and find the element needed.
When using lists, you can change the values of the elements inside, but this is not the case for tuples.

2. Sets and dictionaries are unordered collections whose elements are immutable. Every value in a dictionary has a
unique key attributed to it. They can be used like indexes to find a value. Elements in sets do not have this feature.

3. We can, but it does not always give the correct answer. Computers calculate in binary, but decimal numbers cannot
change perfectly into binary numbers. This can create errors or bugs in the code.
(we cannot do that)

4. A lambda function is a function that can be only used once and has no name. They can be much shorter than normal
functions (usually 1 or 2 lines) and are efficient if you need it once.
(only one expression)

5. A multi-module program has multiple modules, while a multi-package program has multiple packages which contain
multiple modules.

6. A recursive function is a function that uses itself inside it. They can be used like for-loops, but are much slower.
(missing resources consuming, hard to debug)

7. A magic number or a magic value are values that are written without any explanation. They reduce readability and
cause confusion for the reader. They can be avoided by using docstrings or comments to explain the reasoning behind the
value..
(missing: or using variables or constants)

8. Readability and efficiency are the most important factors to a program. It needs to be fast and short, but also easy
for others to understand. Reliability and flexibility are also important as it enhances the user experience.

9. First, you need to plan the software. Choose how you are going to code every step. Then, you need to start programming
and developing it. Finally, you need to search for bugs and prevent the software from breaking at any scenario.

10. An easy way is to add comments to help understanding. You can also split the program into multiple modules or
packages.
