# Question 1

"""
When we use a list, we use it to store arbitrary objects, lists are more flexible in means that we can preform many
different things to change items, sort it, etc...
When we use a tuple, we use it to store items that we do not change, which means data that never changes.
Example: coordinates, names, etc...
"""

# Question 2

"""
When we use a set, we use it to store item that are random because a set doesn't have order the items in a set are
immutable and the set itself is mutable.
When we use a dictionary we right a items and assign it with a value example: Names:Age, Food:Price, etc...
