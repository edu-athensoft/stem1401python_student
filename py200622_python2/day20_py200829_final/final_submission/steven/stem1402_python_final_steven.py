1.
I don't know.
Because normally I just directly use lists.

2.
I don't know.
Because I rarely use these and therefore forgot...

3.
I think yes, but I am not sure how.
Maybe because both of the numbers are very precise.
So the program has to compare each numbers.

4.
Lambda has simpler syntax than function. 
You use it once and there is no need for a name.
For passing a function as an argument.
Therefore it is an easier type of function.

5.
Module is a file containing python statements and definitions.
But packages are bigger "files" containing these modules or other sub-packages.
Multi-module are smaller than multi-package.
Since packages contain a bunch of modules in them.

6.
Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.
But tracing and debugging are kind of difficult.
Recursion uses more memory. 
Because the function has to add to the stack with each recursion and keep the values there until that part is done.
Therefore recursions can be slow.

7.
Magic number/value are informations in the program that are unknown to others or difficult to understand.
But you know what are the meanings of these infos since you are the one who wrote this program.
We should avoid writing these in our programs because this is really bad for teamwork.
If you were working on a big project with your friends
When you write your part of the program, then your friend wouldn't know what your program is for
And this will decrease your speed of finishing the project
I think that to avoid these, you should add notes on top of these phrases.
By using # you can add notes to tell what these infos are used for.

8.
Black box check - check if the program is runnable
If the program result is good.
White bow check - check if the program is readable/understandable meaning that it has easier syntax.
If the program itself is good.

9. 
1 - You must tell everyone what this software is for
2 - Develop the software, design, program, test and fix bugs
3 - After you set it out for public use, you can still control the software
    Therefore, you can upgrade it slowly
10. 
First of all you have to have easy syntax, with this you will need small blocks of program.
And you will have to write notes using # for each of your blocks of program
Second, before you hand out the final part, you have to keep testing your program until you try and fix everything bugs.
