	magic				1/4		0.25
	rare				1/10	0.1
	legendary			1/100	0.01
	ancient legendary	1/500	0.002

Please write some test code to simulate opening chest for a couple of times (like 100 times), 500 times, 1000 times or more
Analyze the result with your settings of probability of items dropping from the chests.
