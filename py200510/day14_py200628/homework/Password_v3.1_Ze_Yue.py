v3. Encrypting Password
For security reasons, the password should not directly be persisted into databases in original form.
It is recommended that every character should get right shifted for 3 steps.
For example,
a -> d,   b -> e,  c -> f,  â€¦, 0 -> 3
print out the encrypted password
then decrypt the password and print it out to compare it with the original one
