# Part 1

# question 1
# We use tuple when we dont want that anyone will change our program,
# list has more builtin function than tuple though

# question 2
# we use dictionary when we want a key to store another thing

# question 3
# when the loops or the functions are too long, they may affect the quality of your program

# question 4
# No, because 1.1 + 2.2 isn't equal to 3.3

# question 5
# a multi-package program is a project with a lot of python package and a multi-file program is one of those package

# question 6
# syntax for exception handling:
# try, except, else, finally
# we use them to avoid errors if you aren't sure of your program

# question 7
# the recursion function is slow and requires more storage

# question 8
# a magic number or a magic value is a number or a value that the user doesnt know why its here,
# the user will not understand if you write them, we just need to put a variable before it to avoid them

# question 9
# when we produce a software, we need to write a plan and a requirement file

# question 10
# try to reformat your file, put function, try to avoid magic numbers and put some comments and a docstring

shutil.copyfile(original, target)

# question 2
a = {'1': 1, '3': 3, '2': 2, '4': 4}
b = sorted(a)
