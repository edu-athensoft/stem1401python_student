"""
Compiler:
Compiler converts one language to another language.

Interpreter:
Interpreter executes the source program or target program( got from compilation step ) one statement at a time.
Code optimization is not possible because it scans each line executes it. So there is no possibility to see ahead of the current line and optimise it.
