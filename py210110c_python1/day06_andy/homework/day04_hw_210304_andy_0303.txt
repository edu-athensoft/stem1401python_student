  Static typing means that types are known and checked for correctness before running your program. This is
often done by the language's compiler.Static typing does not imply that you have to declare all the
variables first, before you use them; variables maybe be initialized anywhere, but developers have to do so
before they use those variables anywhere.

  Dynamic typed programming languages are those languages in which variables must necessarily be defined
before they are used. This implies that dynamic typed languages do not require the explicit declaration of
the variables before theyâ€™re used. Python is an example of a dynamic typed programming language, and so
is PHP.
