 In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction
from the details of the computer. In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language
elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems
(e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when
using a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a programming
language is.
  The only true low level programming is machine code or assembly (asm). Assembly is as close as possible to
what the CPU (the computer's processor) can execute, as it is literally a text translation of the binary
code which the CPU understands.
