1. Understanding A real project/product

The goals
    provide calculating application to my friends or families in everyday life.
    provide this feature to public

The value of the project/product
    share value of small utilities to public or community
    simple calculation
    cross-platform software/application
    customize our calculator features

creative and innovative work
    motivation and core value of impact

Bring it to live



2. How to successfully complete a project?
(idea)

Max - workflow
identifing function/features

work out a plan
   function list
   required techniques/technologies

write code
layout after writing code

check code
revise and refine

============================

Steven - workflow

Analyze the project
result: functionalities

write code
layout after writing code

check code
debug, fix bugs

============================

Yi - workflow
Plan
   layout
   feature

Technical risk
    trial, prototype

Write code

Check code
    debug, fix bugs


=============================
common phases

1. Requirement
2. Analysis and Design
3. Implementation
4. Test
5. Deployment

1. Requirement
Planning for features, layout/UI
what to do?
i.e.
feature 01 - display the expression and the result in text

description (incomplete, inaccurate) -> requirement
business requirement  -> (customer, development team)
system requirement -> (development team)

activity of req analysis:
1. elaborate/extract feature points from description
2. list and write down with a number

using statement to describe features
i.e.
r01. User can input an arithmetic expression.
     constraints: +, -, *, /, *
     supports: integer, floating number  (decimal)
r02. System can perform calculating on the expression and return a result
r03. System can display the expression and result

r04. User can clear all input
r05. User can correct the input by removing characters

Prototype (Draft)
rg01. landscape
rg02. system default theme

wireframe


2. Design
How to do?
basic level
what technologies to apply/employ?
web / desktop (CLI, GUI) / embedded

high level
step 1. list all possible solution

To make sure for each feature:
how to input
how to process
how to output

i.e.
feature 01: User can input an arithmetic expression.
how to input
  user clicks buttons one by one
  desc:
     and each button generates a char

how to process
  desc:
    then user get a sequence of char
    combine them into a string of expression

how to output
  step 1. list all possible solution
  opt 1. Label
  opt 2. Entry
  opt 3. Message
  opt 4. Button

  step 2. make decision
  decision:  using Label



2. Implementation  (writing code, preparing or processing required resources)
3. Testing (find bugs, debug and remove bugs,  revise and refine)
