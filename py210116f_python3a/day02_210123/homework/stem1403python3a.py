A Graphical User Interface(GUI) is the first thing your user sees and interacts with when he opens your application or website. Having a good GUI goes a long way in increasing your platform’s reputation and user count. A user interface usually includes a host of visual elements like icons, buttons, graphics, displayed text, and several other forms of input, like checkbox, text input boxes, and such.
It’s the combination of all these elements that makes up a vital part of your application or website’s user experience. Input to these visual elements can be from the usual mediums, such as keyboards, mice, and touchscreens.

Types of GUI: sources: https://hackr.io/blog/python-frameworks
1. Full-Stack Framework: Such frameworks are a one-stop-solution for all developer requirements. Form generators, form validation, and template layouts are usually available with a typical full-stack framework.

2. Microframework
These are lightweight frameworks that don’t offer additional functionalities and features, such as database abstraction layer, form validation, and specific tools and libraries. Developers using a microframework need to add a lot of code and additional requirements manually.

3. Asynchronous Framework
Gaining popularity recently, any asynchronous framework is a microframework that allows for handling a large set of concurrent connections. Typically, an asynchronous framework built for Python uses the programming language’s asyncio library.

Examples:
    1. AIOHTTP
    2. Bottle
    3. CubicWeb
    4. Tkinter
    5. PySimpleGUI
    6. Django
