1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.

2. Write a Python program to count the number of characters 
(character frequency) in a string.
Sample String : google.com'
Expected Result : {'o': 3, 'g': 2, '.': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1, 'm': 1, 'c': 1}

3. Write a Python program to get a string made of 
the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. 
If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the empty string. 

Sample String : 'w3resource'
Expected Result : 'w3ce'
Sample String : 'w3'
Expected Result : 'w3w3'
Sample String : ' w'
Expected Result : Empty String 

6. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string 
(length should be at least 3). 
If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. 
If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged. 

Sample String : 'abc'
Expected Result : 'abcing'
Sample String : 'string'
Expected Result : 'stringly'

7. Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substring 
'not' and 'poor' from a given string, if 'not' follows the 'poor', 
replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'. 
Return the resulting string. 

Sample String : 'The lyrics is not that poor!'
'The lyrics is poor!'
Expected Result : 'The lyrics is good!'
'The lyrics is poor!'

8. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and 
returns the length of the longest one.
